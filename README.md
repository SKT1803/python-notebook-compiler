# PYTHON-COMPILER — Lightweight Notebook-style Python Runner (Docker-isolated)

A Vite + React front-end and a Go (Gin) back-end that execute Python code **inside isolated Docker containers**. 

Write code cells, add Markdown comments and images, upload data files, choose a runtime (“Python”, “Base”, “ML”), and run one cell or **Run All**. Plots are captured automatically and shown inline.

---

## Live Demo

**Frontend/UI Demo**
The live deployment currently includes **only the UI** — backend runtimes and Docker-based execution are not active in this environment.

You can explore the interface, create/edit notebooks, and see simulated execution outputs (Demo Mode), but actual code execution is **disabled**.

🌐 Live UI: [python-notebook-compiler](https://python-notebook-compiler.vercel.app/)

## Highlights

- **Notebook-style blocks**: `code`, `comment (Markdown)`, and `image`. Drag & drop to reorder.

- **Execute**: Run a single cell or **Run All**. Cancel a running cell.

- **Clean output**: stdout/stderr with execution duration; noisy traceback frames (launcher/runpy/etc.) are filtered for readability.

- **Plot capture**: In `Base` and `ML` runtimes, `matplotlib` is patched so figures are saved and returned to the UI as inline PNGs.

- **Runtime selection**:

  - **Python** (3.11 slim)

  - **Base**: numpy, pandas, scipy, scikit-learn, matplotlib, seaborn, pillow, requests, bs4, lxml, pyarrow, openpyxl

  - **ML**: Base + xgboost, lightgbm

- **Resource** limits: Small/Medium/Large presets mapped to Docker `--memory` and `--cpus`.

- **Files panel**: Drag & drop or file picker, single-file and total quota indicators, toast notifications, remove files.

- **Export**s: Download as `.ipynb` (Jupyter compatible) or `.py` script. (PDF button present but disabled for now.)

- **Line numbers & highlighting**: Custom tokenizer for Python syntax highlighting.

- **Markdown comments**: Toolbar for heading/bold/italic/code/list/link, live preview, undo/redo.

## Architecture
```bash

Client (Vite/React)
  ├─ Notebook (block flow, Run/Run All, runtime & resources)
  ├─ CodeEditor (line numbers, Tab indent, Ctrl/Cmd+Enter)
  ├─ CommentBlock (Markdown + toolbar, live preview)
  ├─ FilesPanel (uploads, quotas, drag & drop, toasts)
  └─ DownloadMenu (.ipynb / .py)

Server (Go + Gin)
  ├─ POST /execute
  ├─ Validates size limits from base64 payloads
  ├─ Writes temp workspace (user code + uploaded files)
  ├─ Generates runner.py (matplotlib patch in Base/ML)
  ├─ Runs isolated Docker container (no network)
  └─ Returns combined output + captured plots (data URIs)

Runtimes (Docker)
  ├─ python:3.11-slim
  ├─ py-sandbox:base
  └─ py-sandbox:ml


```

**Data flow**: UI → `/execute` → temp dir on server → `runner.py` → `docker run` → output & `_plots/*.png` → UI.

## Tech stack

**Front-end**

- React 18 + Vite

-  Drag & drop: `@hello-pangea/dnd`

- Markdown: `react-markdown` + custom toolbar

- Icons: `lucide-react`, `react-icons`

- PDF export infra: `jspdf` (button currently disabled)

- Custom syntax highlighter (`highlight.js` in the repo) — rule-based tokenization (no external lib)

**Back-end**

- Go 1.23

- Gin web framework + CORS middleware

- Executes code via **Docker CLI** with strict isolation and resource caps

**Runtimes (Docker images)**

- `python:3.11-slim`

- `py-sandbox:base` → numpy, pandas, scipy, scikit-learn, matplotlib, seaborn, pillow, requests, bs4, lxml, pyarrow, openpyxl

- `py-sandbox:ml` → Base + xgboost, lightgbm

## Running the project

> Prereqs: **Docker Desktop running** (Windows/macOS) or Docker daemon (Linux).  
> Optional for local dev: **Node 18+**, **Go 1.23+**.


### 1) Run with Docker

####  First-time setup (clean machine)

Use this when you have **no images/containers/volumes yet** (e.g., after a full clean).

1. **Go to the project folder**
```powershell
cd "C:\Users\<USERNAME>\OneDrive\Desktop\python-notebook-compiler"
```

2. **Build the Python Base image**
```powershell
docker compose build pybase
```
> Contains Python 3.11 + scientific libs (numpy, pandas, matplotlib, …).

3. **Build the Python ML image**
```powershell
docker compose build pyml
```
> Builds on top of **Base** (adds xgboost, lightgbm).

4. **Build the remaining services**
```powershell
docker compose build
```
> Builds server, client (and nginx base) images.

5. **Start everything (detached)**
 ```powershell
docker compose up -d
```  

6. **(Optional) Verify containers are up**
 ```powershell
docker ps
```  
> You should see all services in Up state.

**Default endpoints**

- Frontend → http://localhost:5173
- Backend → http://localhost:8080


#### Normal start (images already exist)

1. **Go to the project folder**
```powershell
cd "C:\Users\<USERNAME>\OneDrive\Desktop\python-notebook-compiler"
```

2. **Start services**
```powershell
docker compose up -d
```

If you changed code and need a rebuild for specific services:
```powershell
docker compose build client
docker compose build server
docker compose up -d
```
> docker compose build client: changes on the client side.  
> docker compose build server: changes on the server side.  
> Tip: docker compose up --build -d also works to rebuild what’s needed automatically.  



### 2) Run locally (without Docker)

**Important — build Docker runtimes at least once**  

- If you plan to use the **Base/ML** runtimes, you must first build the Docker images (see **1) Run with Docker → First-time setup**) so those images exist.  
- Local mode does **not** include those Python environments unless you install the dependencies yourself; use the plain **Python** runtime locally otherwise.  


#### First-time local setup

1. **Server (Go/Gin**
```powershell
cd server
go mod tidy
go run main.go
```

2. **Client (Vite/React) — open a new terminal:**
```powershell
cd client
npm install
npm run dev
```

> Make sure client/.env contains:
```powershell
VITE_BACKEND_URL=http://localhost:8080
VITE_TOTAL_UPLOAD_LIMIT=52428800
VITE_SINGLE_FILE_LIMIT=5242880
```

####  Normal local start

1. **Server**
```powershell
cd server
go run main.go
```

2. Client
```powershell
cd client
npm run dev
```


### Notes & gotchas

- **Docker Desktop must be running** before any `docker compose` commands.

- If `docker compose build pyml` fails, you likely haven’t built **pybase** first. Run:
- 
```powershell
docker compose build pybase
docker compose build pyml
```

- If you deleted images, you must rebuild **Base** and **ML** again.

- If you delete **volumes**, any data stored there will be lost. (This project doesn’t ship a DB by default, but the warning applies if you add one.)

- **Windows/macOS vs Linux**:
Commands are the same; on Linux ensure your user has access to `/var/run/docker.sock` (add user to the `docker` group and re-login).

- **Ports**: 5173 (frontend), 8080 (backend). Adjust if they clash with other services on your machine.

## How it works (execution flow)

1. **Request**: The UI posts `code`, selected `runtime`, resource presets (`mem`, `cpu`), and optional `files` (Data URLs) to `POST /execute`.

2. **Limits**: The server calculates sizes without decoding (from base64 body length) and enforces:

- `SINGLE_FILE_LIMIT` (per file)

- `TOTAL_UPLOAD_LIMIT` (sum of all files in the request)

3. **Workspace**: A temp directory is created. Uploaded files are decoded and written; user code is saved as `code_user.py`.

4. **Runner**:

- For `Base/ML`, `runner.py` sets `MPLBACKEND=Agg`, patches `plt.show()` to save figures into `_plots/`, and also saves remaining figures at the end.

- For `Python`, a minimal `runpy.run_path(...)` launcher is used.

5. **Docker**: The server starts a throwaway container:

- `--network none` (no internet access)

- `--memory <mem>` and `--cpus <cpu>`

- `--pids-limit 50`

- `-v <temp>:/code` and `-w /code`

6. **Response**: Combined stdout/stderr and execution duration are returned. If plots exist, they are read from `_plots/*.png`, base64-encoded, and returned as `data:image/png;base64,....`
The UI displays text output + a gallery of plots.

**State across cells**: When running a single cell, the UI rebuilds a “cumulative code” prefix from **previous successfully executed code cells** (definitions, imports, assignments, blocks), so later cells see the state defined earlier, similar to a notebook session.

**Traceback cleanup**: Common launcher/runpy/importlib frames are filtered before rendering, so users see the meaningful part of the error.
